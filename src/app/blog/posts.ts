    title: 'April 2025',
    summary: "April was all about building momentum and laying a foundation. I spent the month dialing in a routine that fits around my full-time schedule, while making solid progress on my developer portfolio using Next.js. I learned the fundamentals of Node.js, built my first backend routes, and gained a clearer understanding of fullstack project structure. I also started growing my LeetCode GitHub repo and committed to daily problem-solving. It wasnâ€™t the flashiest month, but it was productive, consistent, and exactly what I needed to move forward.",
